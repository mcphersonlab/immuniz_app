# Project Title

Welcome to our Science Project Repository!

This project uses [CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)](https://credit.niso.org/) to clearly specify the roles and contributions of each individual participant from the outset. CRediT enables transparency and recognition for the diverse contributions to scholarly work.

## Getting Started

> To reserve a role, add your GitHub username under the "Assigned To" column for the relevant role(s).

### 2. How to Assign Roles

1. Fork the repository.
2. Edit this README, adding your GitHub username in the "Assigned To" column.
3. Open a pull request for review by others.

Example:
```markdown
| **Resources**           | ... | @JacobKMcPherson |
```

### 3. Collaboration Guidelines

- Respect role assignments and communicate early if you wish to adjust or expand your contributions.
- Uphold scientific integrity and recognize all contributions.
- Updates to assigned roles should be proposed via PR and require agreement from the team.

### 4. Role Updates and Accountability

Role assignments are established **at project start** but can be amended as needed (with consensus). The README serves as a living record of contributions.
