~

% ====================================================================
%       ELEMENT 3: STANDARDS
% ====================================================================
\subsection*{Element 3: Standards}

State what common data standards will be applied to the scientific data and associated metadata to enable interoperability of datasets and resources, and provide the name(s) of the data standards that will be applied and describe how these data standards will be applied to the scientific data generated by the research proposed in this project. If applicable, indicate that no consensus standards exist.

\subsubsection*{A. Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:}

NIH expects that in drafting Plans, researchers maximize the appropriate sharing of scientific data. Describe and justify any applicable factors or data use limitations affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data related to informed consent, privacy and confidentiality protections, and any other considerations that may limit the extent of data sharing. 

% ===== B. WHETHER ACCESS TO SCIENTIFIC DATA WILL BE CONTROLLED ======
\subsubsection*{B. Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:}

State whether access to the scientific data will be controlled (i.e., made available by a data repository only after approval).

% ===== C. PROTECTIONS FOR PRIVACY, RIGHTS, AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF HUMAN RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS
\subsubsection*{C. Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:}

If generating scientific data derived from humans, describe how the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants will be protected (e.g., through de-identification, Certificates of Confidentiality, and other protective measures).
