%The results may be divided with subheadings. In our view, good subheadings convey information about the findings, so we encourage you to be specific. For example, "Factor X requires factor Y to function in process Z" is better than "Analysis of factors X and Y by approach Q." We recommend that you use similar language in your figure titles for clarity and structural harmony. Please do not use numbered subheadings. For some formats, ``results and discussion" may be combined under a single heading.
